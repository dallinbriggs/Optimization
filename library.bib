abstract = {We present a complete solution for the visual navigation of a small-scale, low-cost quadrocopter in unknown environments. Our approach relies solely on a monocular camera as the main sensor, and therefore does not need external tracking aids such as GPS or visual markers. Costly computations are carried out on an external laptop that communicates over wireless LAN with the quadrocopter. Our approach consists of three components: a monocular SLAM system, an extended Kalman filter for data fusion, and a PID controller. In this paper, we (1) propose a simple, yet effective method to compensate for large delays in the control loop using an accurate model of the quadrocopter's flight dynamics, and (2) present a novel, closed-form method to estimate the scale of a monocular SLAM system from additional metric sensors. We extensively evaluated our system in terms of pose estimation accuracy, flight accuracy, and flight agility using an external motion capture system. Furthermore, we compared the convergence and accufracy of our scale estimation method for an ultrasound altimeter and an air pressure sensor with filtering-based approaches. The complete system is available as open-source in ROS. This software can be used directly with a low-cost, off-the-shelf Parrot AR.Drone quadrocopter, and hence serves as an ideal basis for follow-up research projects. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Haines2011,
abstract = {Autonomous air vehicles frequently rely on GPS as a primary source of state feedback. However, relying on GPS disallows operation in enclosed spaces, un- der heavy vegetation or near large obstacles since GPS does not provide suffi- cient accuracy in these environments. Similar work in GPS-denied navigation uses laser-based odometry, structured-light or places visual markers in the environment. These approaches are not appropriate for operating in unstructured environments, therefore it is necessary to develop a system around more robust vision-based tech- niques. This work presents a method for controlling an autonomous, multi-rotor he- licopter based on visual odometry which consists of two major sections. First, a method for developing an accurate dynamic model of a multi-rotor helicopter based on a combination of first priciples and emperical data is presented. This modeling technique is used to develop a control system which enables trajectory tracking. Second, a vision-based state-estimation technique is presented along with a hardware implementation that enables execution of the algorithms in real-time on board a small vehicle with strict payload constraints. The methods described are implemented in flight-ready hardware with a minimal weight, power and com- putational footprint. The system is then evaluated on board a small, eight-rotor helicopter. We successfully demonstrate vision-based trajectory tracking in flight on this vehicle.},

A few groups have built and analyzed MAVs in the 10-cm range [2], [3]. One of the smallest MAV is the Picoftyer with a 60-mmpropellor diameter and a mass of 3.3 g [4]. Platforms in the 50-cm range are more prevalent with several groups having built and flown systems of this size [5]-[7]. In fact, there are severalcommercially available radiocontrolled (PvC) helicopters and research-grade helicopters in this size range [8].},

@article{Blosch2010,
abstract = {Within the research on Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), the field on flight control and autonomous mission execution is one of the most active. A crucial point is the localization of the vehicle, which is especially difficult in unknown, GPS-denied environments. This paper presents a novel vision based approach, where the vehicle is localized using a downward looking monocular camera. A state-of-the-art visual SLAM algorithm tracks the pose of the camera, while, simultaneously, building an incremental map of the surrounding region. Based on this pose estimation a LQG/LTR based controller stabilizes the vehicle at a desired setpoint, making simple maneuvers possible like take-off, hovering, setpoint following or landing. Experimental data show that this approach efficiently controls a helicopter while navigating through an unknown and unstructured environment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work describing a micro aerial vehicle able to navigate through an unexplored environment (independently of any external aid like GPS or artificial beacons), which uses a single camera as only exteroceptive sensor.},

@article{Shen2011,
abstract = {We are interested in the problem of surveilling and exploring environments that include both indoor and outdoor settings. Aerial vehicles offer mobility and perspective advantages over ground platforms and micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) are particularly applicable to buildings with multiple floors where stairwells can be an obstacle to ground vehicles. A challenge when operating in indoor environments is the lack of an external source of localization such as GPS. For these reasons, in this work we focus on autonomous navigation in buildings with multiple floors without requiring an external source of localization or prior knowledge of the environment. To ensure that the robot is fully autonomous, we require all computation to occur on the robot without need for external infrastructure, communication, or human interaction beyond high-level commands. Therefore, we pursue a system design and methodology capable of autonomous navigation with real-time performance on a mobile processor using only onboard sensors (Fig. 1); where in this work autonomous navigation considers multi-floor mapping with loop closure, localization, planning, and control.},
